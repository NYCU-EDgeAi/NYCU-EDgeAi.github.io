My research group is investigating how best to build the next generation of machine-learning-centric computer systems. We study methods to co-design and co-optimize neural networks and the hardware on which they run, with a special interest in reconfigurable computing using devices like FPGAs. Our goal is to enable efficient deep learning in both mobile devices and datacenters. Our current research projects include:
* AI computing platform design (AI運算平台設計)
* Approximate computing for AI applications (近似計算於AI之應用) [[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvgrDtP_eVc)], [[detail](http://approximate.computer/approxbib/)]
* Cybersecurity and hardware Trojan (安全與硬體特洛伊)
* Electronic design automation, system-on-chip/chip-multiprocessor design verification and optimization (SoC設計自動化)
* High-performance energy-aware computing, approximate/green computing (高效節能計算)
* Reliable/trustworthy system design, design for reliability/trust (可靠系統設計)
